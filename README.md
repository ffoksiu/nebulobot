## ‚ú® Features

NebuloBot comes packed with features, with many more planned for future development.

### Core Functionality
*   **Dynamic Statuses:** Your bot will display various activities (Playing, Watching, Listening, Competing, Streaming, or Custom) that rotate automatically at configurable intervals.
*   **Advanced Logging:** Detailed, colored console logs help you monitor bot activity and troubleshoot issues effectively, with module-specific tags for easy identification.

### Integrated Systems
*   **Database Integration:** Designed to connect with a MySQL database for persistent storage, enabling advanced features like user levels and economy.
*   **Text Leveling System (TLS):**
    *   Users gain experience points (XP) for sending messages.
    *   XP required for each level is fully customizable via a mathematical formula.
    *   Customizable cooldowns prevent XP farming.
    *   Automatic level-up announcements in a designated channel, with fully customizable rich embeds (title, content, color, footer, and placeholders for user/level info).

### Modular Extensibility
NebuloBot's architecture allows for easy expansion with more features like:
*   **Voice Leveling System:** Gain XP for time spent in voice channels.
*   **Economy System:** In-server currency, shops, and minigames.
*   **Moderation Tools:** Commands for server moderation (e.g., clearing messages, banning users).
*   **Giveaways System:** Host and manage giveaways directly through the bot.
*   **Advanced Logging:** Detailed logging of server events (e.g., message edits/deletes, member joins/leaves) to dedicated log channels.
These modules are ready for initialization but require further configuration and implementation for their specific features.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get your NebuloBot up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites
*   **Node.js:** Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your machine.
*   **Discord Account:** You need a Discord account to create a bot application.
*   **Bot Application:**
    1.  Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
    2.  Click "New Application", give it a name, and create it.
    3.  Navigate to the "Bot" section on the left sidebar. Click "Add Bot".
    4.  **Copy your Bot Token:** This is a secret key. **Do NOT share it with anyone!**
    5.  **Enable Intents:** Under "Privileged Gateway Intents", enable `PRESENCE INTENT`, `GUILD MESSAGES INTENT`, and `MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT`. These are crucial for the bot to function correctly (especially for statuses and text levels). If you plan to use voice levels in the future, enable `GUILD VOICE STATES` too.
    6.  **Invite your Bot:** Go to "OAuth2" -> "URL Generator".
        *   Under "SCOPES", select `bot`.
        *   Under "BOT PERMISSIONS", grant necessary permissions (e.g., `Read Messages/View Channels`, `Send Messages`, `Manage Roles` for future features, `Embed Links`).
        *   Copy the generated URL and open it in your browser to invite the bot to your server.
*   **MySQL Database:** NebuloBot requires a MySQL/MariaDB database server. Ensure you have one set up and note down the host, port, username, password, and desired database name (e.g., `bot_database`).

### Configuration
NebuloBot uses two configuration files: `.env` (for your secret token) and `config.json` (for all other settings).

1.  **`.env` File (Your Bot Token)**
    *   Go to `.env` file.
    *   Add your Discord Bot Token to this file:
        ```ini
        DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_GOES_HERE
        ```
        **Remember to replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_GOES_HERE` with the actual token you copied from the Discord Developer Portal.** Keep this file private. Do not share this under any circumstances.

2.  **`config.json` File (Bot Settings)**
    *   In the root directory, you'll find a file named `config_default.json` and `config.json`. Config is what's loaded. config_default is used in case your configuration file gets deleted or if you'd like to reset settings fabrically.
    *   **Don't edit config_default.json unless you're sure what you're doing.**
    *   **Important:** `config.json` must NOT contain any comments (lines starting with `//`) Additionally, it is neccessary for you to follow value types (eg integer: `1` is not the same as a string `"1"` and it **may break your config**.)
    *   Open `config.json` and customize the settings within its sections:

    ```json
    {
      "main": {
        "bot_name": "...",
        "status_change_interval_seconds": 10,
        "bot_statuses": [

        *   `xp_gain_per_message`: XP gained for each message.
        *   `xp_cooldown_seconds`: Cooldown (in seconds) before a user can gain XP again from messages.

        *   `level_up_channel_id`: The ID of the channel where level-up announcements will be sent. Set to `null` to send in the channel where the user leveled up.
        *   `level_up_embed_title`, `level_up_embed_color`, `level_up_embed_content`, `level_up_embed_footer`: Customize the appearance and text of the level-up message.
            *   **Placeholders:** You can use `{user.name}`, `{user.id}`, `{level}`, and `{time}` within the embed strings.
    *   **Other sections (`voice_levels`, `economy`, `moderation`, `logs`, `giveaways`):** These modules are initialized but require further configuration and implementation for their specific features.

### Running the Bot
Once configured, navigate to your bot's directory in the terminal and run:
```bash
node index.js
```
Your bot should come online and start displaying logs in the console.
